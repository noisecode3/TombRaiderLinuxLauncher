This is a test database.
I will list the games in the database here by id number.

You can access the game files here ~/.local/share/TombRaiderLinuxLauncher/ID.TRLE
where ID is the number listed here.
If you use you own database you can update it
with updateDB_1.0.0.py then updateDB_1.1.0.py then to updateDB_1.1.1.py.
But make backup before. I can implement in app json scraping from trcustoms.org
to get new levels. It has a nice json api with minimal compact data for info and nice
picture urls with md5sums. There can be and index database that
get new level id numbers from trcustoms.org or trle.net with very minimal traffic.

  Note: I got the build fix here https://github.com/noisecode3/ogg-winmm

  use dll ovride winmm=n,b

  no problems
  I manage to port this one to Linux native thru TR1X
  the patch for TR1X is in fixes/8/IntoTheRealmOfEternalDarkness.patch
  then you need to add all data from the zip, that is
  (data fmv music and pictures) should be put next to TR1X 

  It is the same for the most part but with 60 fps
  The second level had broken timer, but works now
  Some issues can be addressed next time.

  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TR1X
