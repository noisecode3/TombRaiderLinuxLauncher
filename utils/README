This is a test database.
I will list the games in the database here by id number.
Only the ones that I can play through without getting stuck
because of a bug will stay in the database. You can access the
files here like this ~/.local/share/TombRaiderLinuxLauncher/5.TRLE
If the directory 5.TRLE would be missing it will attempt to try
installing it.
