There are rumours of Shiva statues becoming alive. Also, a sinister cult founded by former RX Tech members, whose leader is able to shoot fireballs, is wreaking havoc in the small country of Shivania (fictional, in South Asia). To prevent such parties with bad intentions from misusing these additional artifacts, she decides to travel there and find them herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Important:</b> Please do play this game with the executable in this package!<br/>\n<br/> \r\nHow to leave the boat?
