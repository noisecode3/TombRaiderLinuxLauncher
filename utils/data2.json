According to an old writing forwarded to the Holy Church, one man tried to use it and was consumed by it, opening a portal to a demonic world. The templar knights manage to secure this artifact in a very ancient cathedral, but its energy was so strong that all the island where the cathedral was built ended up being corrupted by a dark power. In response, the Holy Church ordered to bury the artifact in the depths of the cathedral and lock it with a sacred key, erasing every registry of the damned island from the maps.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSophia had come across a very old map which still has the location of the island, but she could not find the sacred key. Fortunately, Lara has a clue of where the key is. Turns out it was in Paris all along, being exhibit as a unique antiquity on the museum, named \"The Templars Scepter\". Now she needs to break into the museum to get the scepter and get the map kept in Sophias office to find the way to the island before SLincs search team discover the cathedral.</td>", "walkthrough": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\n<head>\n<meta content=\"text/html;
