# Tomb Raider Linux Launcher
A tool to run Tomb Raider classics 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on linux with Wine/Proton. Problems that you may face for 3 and 4 are one particular input problem and sometimes graphical glitches, crashes or lags. The work around for the input problem is to avoid ctrl alt. The secound work around is to use a kernel sutable for gaming/wine and try to use mature suitable graphics drivers, usually open source. That will get you far if you want to play those games, but you should also know modding is tricky and only some might work. Im doing it for fun and I would love to learn more c++ and Qt

This application will be written in c++ for the gui and for modding and manipulation config files. Bash for launching with Steam or lutris or just Wine.

# Features


- with steam or lutris to select a map from trle.net to play

- launch along the game a controller mapper like qjoypad or antimicrox

- script so that I dont have to manually move all game files when I want to play a mod with steam to steams tomb raider game folder

- preserve game savefiles and configurations for all maps and moods.

- chech if I forgott to connect controller and so on... On linux. I like my Steam controller configurations also.

The game is old and broken even on windows...
