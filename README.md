# TombRaiderLinuxSteamManager
a tool for Tomb Raider classics (1 only lutris work for me) 2,3,4,5 with steam to select a map from trle.net I play some of Tomb Raider classic, Its almost the only game I still play.
I use a ps4 controller and want to make a tool or a script so that I dont have to manually move all game files when I want to play a mod. and preserve game savefiles and configurations for all maps and moods. and autostart the game. chech if I forgott to connect ps4 and so on... On linux
I like my Steam ps4 configurations and Im probably the only one how plays this game on linux. Im doing it for fun and I would love to learn more c++ and Qt

How to play Tomb Raider 3

I have this workaround for input bug that happens if the player uses Ctrl and Alt. This keys can corrupt the game on proton and crash the game randomly. You should change them inside the game. Or edit the config.txt inside the game folder. You should keep a copy of this file because this file can become corrupted. Sprint / key as in the picture will not work, but wont crash the game. The picture shows a working configuration for Linux.

The next problem is that sometimes steam input will crash the game after the core design intro video. If this happens shutting down steam and open it again work. I have played this game over 80 hours on steam and its working and never crash in the game if I dont use Ctrl and Alt.(and dont change any graphics settings in the game) I manage to change gamma settings in the game dont recommend it, it will usually lead to crashes.

The game is old an broken even on windows...
I recommend these patches
