Put the file ~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/dgvoodoo2/v2.8.2/dgVoodoo.conf
It has helped me fix some crashes from using default dgVoodoo.conf
Here's what was changed:
    DirectX:
            ForceVerticalSync: true
            Resolution: max_qhd_isf
            VRAM: 256
            dgVoodooWatermark: false
    General:
            CaptureMouse: false
            FullScreenMode: false
            ScalingMode: stretched_ar
