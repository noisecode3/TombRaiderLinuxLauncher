Developed for but can work with others, it should but there is no garantee
Playstation DualShock4 controller hw_version=0x0000b418 fw_version=0x0000a00b

I could not get Dpad to work with this API but the Sticks works.
I use the Dpad only around edges but can play without it.
This is just a way to take the kernel RAW when everything else is not working
You might just need to replace this line.
device = evdev.InputDevice('/dev/input/event21')  # Replace X with the correct number

The quick way:
sudo modprobe uinput
sudo chown root:input /dev/uinput
sudo chmod 0660 /dev/uinput

Fixing /dev/uinput Permissions

To make it persist across reboots, add it to /etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf:

echo "uinput" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf

2 Give Your User Access to /dev/uinput

By default, only root and the input group can access it.

    Add yourself to the input group:

    sudo usermod -aG input $USER

    Log out and back in (or reboot) for the group change to take effect.

If that still doesn't work, you might need udev rules.
3 Create a udev Rule to Fix Permissions

If /dev/uinput still has crw------- (only root access), create a new rule:

sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules

Add this line:

KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"

Then apply the new rule:

sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger

Now, check if the permissions are fixed:

ls -l /dev/uinput

It should look like:

crw-rw---- 1 root input 10, 223 Feb  1 4:20 /dev/uinput

If it still says crw-------, reboot.

Now your Python script should be able to read/write to /dev/uinput without sudo! ðŸš€
