Guide: Setting Up Tomb Raider 2 on Wine with TR2Main & OGG Audio Support
1. Install TR2Main (Enhanced Engine for Tomb Raider 2)

    Open a terminal and navigate to the game directory:

cd /path/to/your/tomb-raider-2/

Extract the TR2Main files into the game directory:

    unzip /path/to/TR2Main_v0.9.0.zip

    This will replace the original Tomb2.exe with the improved TR2Main version.

2. Replace winmm.dll for OGG Audio Support

Tomb Raider 2 originally used CD audio for music. To enable OGG playback in Wine, you need to replace winmm.dll with ogg-winmm:

    Download ogg-winmm from GitHub:
        https://github.com/ayuanx/ogg-winmm
    Extract the winmm.dll from the archive.
    Copy winmm.dll into the game directory, replacing the existing one:

    cp /path/to/ogg-winmm/winmm.dll /path/to/your/tomb-raider-2/

3. Convert or Extract Audio Files

You need to ensure that the game has OGG format music in the music/ directory.
Option 1: Convert Existing MP3s

If you already have the MP3 soundtrack, convert them:

    Navigate to the music/ folder:

cd /path/to/your/tomb-raider-2/music/

Run the conversion script:

    ./convert.sh

Option 2: Extract Audio from the Game Files

If you don't have the MP3 soundtrack, extract it from the gameâ€™s original audio/ files:

    Navigate to the audio/ directory:

cd /path/to/your/tomb-raider-2/audio/

Run the extraction script:

./extract_audio.sh

Ensure that the music/ folder now contains the OGG files.
Remove or move the audio/ directory:

    rm -r /path/to/your/tomb-raider-2/audio/

4. Fixing Video Playback Issues

If cutscenes don't play, you may need to use DXVK (DirectX to Vulkan translation layer).

    Install DXVK:

    WINEPREFIX=/path/to/your/wineprefix winetricks dxvk

    Ensure Wine is using DXVK by setting d3d9.dll to native in winecfg:
        Run winecfg
        Go to the Libraries tab
        Add d3d9 and set it to "Native"

5. Run the Game

Once everything is set up, start the game:

WINEPREFIX=/path/to/your/wineprefix WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winmm=n,b" wine tomb2.exe -setup
Then run:
WINEPREFIX=/path/to/your/wineprefix WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winmm=n,b" wine tomb2.exe
